{"name":"Arduino Spooky Eyes","tagline":"Spooky eyes with Arduino","body":"# Spooky Eyes\r\n\r\nThis lttile project is about having fun with an Arduino. For my daughters spooky birthday party (or Halloween if you want), I wanted to create a special effect. Some years ago my wife bought me an iron helmet which stands on a wooden stick. Wouldn't it be awesome to make the helmet come alive with two demonic eyes?\r\n\r\n## Uploading code to the Arduino mini\r\n\r\nThe Arduino mini does not have a build in USB connector, so we need another way to upload\r\ncode to it. I tried a PL2303TA USB to Serial Bridge Controller, but that didn't work\r\n(I heard the cable delivers 3V power while the Mini needs 5V). Everything I tried resulted in this error:\r\n\r\navrdude: stk500_getsync(): not in sync: resp=0x00\r\n\r\nSo, I switched to a USB serial adapter (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/USBSerial).\r\nRead the following page for instructions:\r\nhttps://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoMini\r\n\r\nThe first attempt gave me the same error as before, but then I tried something by accident...\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n  1. GRN -> GRN\r\n  2. PWR -> PWR\r\n  3. RX -> TX\r\n  4. TX -> RX\r\n  5. Reset -> Reset\r\n  6. !!! remove the reset pin when avrdude is trying to upload the code !!!\r\n  7. done\r\n\r\nNow the Arduino is programmed!\r\n\r\n## Materials\r\n\r\nThese are the materials I used to create one set of eyes:\r\n\r\n  - 2x 10mm diffused red LEDs\r\n  - 2x 150 Ohm resistors\r\n  - 1x Adafruit Perma-Proto Quarter-sized Breadboard PCB\r\n  - 1x Arduino Mini\r\n  - Some wires\r\n\r\nI carefully sawed the Perma-Proto breadboard into two pieces. One for each eye.\r\n\r\n## Eye effects\r\n\r\nThe code I wrote can let the eyes do the following effects:\r\n\r\n  - The eyes can open (fade in);\r\n  - The eyes can close (fade out);\r\n  - When open, the eyes blink every 10-15 seconds;\r\n  - The eyes can go crazy (flicker) once in a while\r\n  - Since everything has to fit inside the helmet I've used an arduino mini which will be powered by a 9V battery.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
