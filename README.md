# Spooky Eyes

Having fun with an Arduino to create spooky eyes for a bithday party or Halloween.
2x 10mm diffused red LEDs are used for the eyes and they are controlled by an Arduino Mini.

I have an iron helmet in which I'm gonna place the eyes. The eyes will do the following:
- open (fade in)
- close (fade out)
- when open, they blink every 10-15 seconds
- they can go crazy (flicker)

The arduino will be powered by a 9V battery.
