# Spooky Eyes

This lttile project is about having fun with an Arduino. For my daughters spooky birthday party (or Halloween if you want), I wanted to create a special effect. Some years ago my wife bought me an iron helmet which stands on a wooden stick. Wouldn't it be awesome to make the helmet come alive with a couple of demon eyes?

For the eyes I used 2x 10mm diffused red LEDs which are controlled by an Arduino.

So far I have the following effects created:

- The eyes can open (fade in);
- The eyes can close (fade out);
- When open, the eyes blink every 10-15 seconds;
- The eyes can go crazy (flicker) once in a while
- Since everything has to fit inside the helmet I've used an arduino mini which will be powered by a 9V battery.
